##### NJ Algorithm from wikipedia
Neighbor joining takes as input a distance matrix specifying the distance between each pair of taxa.
The algorithm starts with a completely unresolved tree, whose topology corresponds to that of a star network,
and iterates over the following steps until the tree is completely resolved and all branch lengths are known:

1-) Based on the current distance matrix calculate the matrix Q (defined below).
2-) Find the pair of distinct taxa i and j (i.e. with i != j) for which
    Q(i,j) has its lowest value. These taxa are joined to a newly created node,
    which is connected to the central node. In the figure at right, f and g are joined to the new node u.
3-) Calculate the distance from each of the taxa in the pair to this new node.
4-) Calculate the distance from each of the taxa outside of this pair to the new node.
5-) Start the algorithm again, replacing the pair of joined neighbors with the new node and using the distances
    calculated in the previous step.


##### The Q-matrix
Based on a distance matrix relating the n taxa, calculate Q as follows:
Q(i,j)=(n-2)d(i,j)-sum[k=1 to n](d(i,k))-sum[k=1 to n](d(j,k))
where d(i,j) is the distance between taxa i and j.

    "karolin" and "kerstin" is 3.
